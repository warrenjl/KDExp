# KDExp: Kernel Density Estimation Prior Distribution for Exposure Uncertainty Propagation 

This package allows for univariate and multivariate kernel density estimation prior distributions, defined by posterior predictive samples collected in a first stage exposure model, to be assigned to exposures within a health outcome regression analysis (continuous, binary, and count models included), and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Please see the "KDExp_Model_Details" and "KDExp_Example" folders for more specific information regarding the statistical model and package use details, respectively.
